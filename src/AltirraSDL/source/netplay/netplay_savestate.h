// Altirra SDL3 netplay - mid-session savestate capture / apply
//
// Two narrow helpers that bridge the netplay resync protocol
// (packets.h / coordinator.cpp) to the emulator's IATSerializable
// snapshot machinery (simulator.cpp, savestateio.h).  They are
// deliberately non-templated and kept out of coordinator.cpp so that
// the pure-lockstep code can still be exercised by tests without
// pulling in g_sim.
//
// The byte buffer is a ZIP archive that contains the same
// savestate.json object graph used by File → Save State.  Peers that
// pass the v3 BootConfig / firmware-CRC handshake are already
// guaranteed to share hardware + firmware and can therefore
// successfully apply each other's snapshots.
